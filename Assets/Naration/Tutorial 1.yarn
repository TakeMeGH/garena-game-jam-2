Hades: Look, they're coming! Quick attack them before it's too late!
Lopi: I can attack using right and left click on your mouse. While you can use A and D button on your keyboard, Hades. Be careful, we can only attack different types of enemies.
Hades: I bet you can tell the difference which character can attack what types of enemies ;).
